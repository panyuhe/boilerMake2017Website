                Rapid information transfer, use of the internet as information exchange as well as a commodity in and of itself- have shaped this generation.
<br/>
<br/>
But this incredible power comes with its own risks.
<br/>
<br/>
In the past 4 years weâ€™ve seen cybersecurity lurch into prevalence.
Sony Hacks, Ashley Madison leaks, celebrity photo leaks, Homeland security having thousands of email addresses released to the public, the DNC email scandal. Just late last year, the mass DDOS- made possible and made real by the same Internet of Things that so many of us are excited about.
<br/>
<br/>
These are incredible times. But these can also be dangerous times.
